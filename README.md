# Reinforcement Learning Based Firewall

## Custom Gymnasium Environment for Sequential Network Security Decision-Making

This repository contains a custom Gymnasium reinforcement learning environment designed to train and evaluate adaptive firewall agents.
The goal is to simulate real-time packet/flow filtering decisions using an RL agent that learns a policy for ALLOW or DENY actions based on traffic features and sequential network behavior.
